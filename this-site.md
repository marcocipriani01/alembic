### The author
Iâ€™m a young astronomy enthusiast, attending the high school somewhere in Italy. In my free time, I take photos of the universe with my telescope and I often write some programs, utilities or Android applications to simplify its use. I set up a Raspberry Pi to control the telescope remotely, motorized the focuser (designing and printing a 3D model for the brackets, programming an Arduino and a Java software for the computer) and the equatorial mount using two stepper motors and I wrote a bunch of code to move them using my smartphone. Together astronomy, I also made some projects for school: an app to factorize polynomials, a digitaal pendulum, which is able to calculate the gravitational acceleration of the Earth and the measurement errors and a Bluetooth car (with an Android app), that I also exposed to Maker Faire Rome when I was only thirteen.
