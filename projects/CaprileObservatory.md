After my final high school exam, a friend of mine asked me if I was available for what turned out to be my greatest project: building an astronomical observatory in the Florence's countryside. Ambitious, hard, but here I am telling you about it! First of all, I am sorry if I will not provide exact instructions on how to build it: as you can imagine, there are so many parts in this observatory that it would take me a year just to describe everything. However, if you want to make your own, I invite you to thinker and come up with your unique solutions to the problems you will certainly face: by doing so, you will certainly learn a lot and enjoy more the journey!
