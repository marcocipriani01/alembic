Don't you think that Maths hard? Right, but I love it. That's why I made this app: MathsTests can help you factorizing polynomials using the Ruffini's rule, and particular trinomials! Fast, lightweight and Open-source, it's a great app for everyone who needs help with polynomials. Psss... I'm not in charge of your bad marks if you use it during tests!
