IPARCOS (Indi Protocol Android Remote COntrol Software) is an INDI client for Android.
It features a generic control panel, a mount joystick-like screen, a focuser controller and a database of objects to point the telescope.
I'm not the main developer of this application, which was originally written by @farom57, but he stopped working on this project long ago. So I completely renewed the user interface, I updated all the libraries and the Android SDK to make it compatible with the latest Android version and I fixed a bunch of bugs.
