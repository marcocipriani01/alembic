IPARCOS (INDI Protocol Android Remote COntrol Software) is an INDI client for Android.
It features a generic control panel, a mount joystick-like screen, a focuser controller and a database of objects to point the telescope.

This is an updated version of @farom57's IPARCOS, whose developed stopped years ago. I completely renewed the user interface, updated all the libraries and added the focuser control.
