The Moon is always a fascinating object. I can never stop gazing at it with the telescope, and even if it is well studied, it continues revealing new incredible details and mysteries: did you know it's full of colours, which show its composition on the surface? Here's "my" Mineral Moon, take a look at it!

### The photo

I took 83 0.005-secs subs at ISO 400, and then I stacked them up with Siril. Further processing using The GIMP and Darktable to enhance the colours and increase saturation and sharpness.
