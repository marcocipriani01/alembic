excerpt: 34x 360 seconds at ISO 1600 (a record!), dark, flat, dark-flats and bias
  frames, processing in Astro Pixel Processor and The GIMP. Nikon D3300 with UHC filter
  from a very light polluted area, Sky-Watcher Newtonian 200mm f/5, EQ5. Due to the
  long focal length, the nebula is partially cropped, but the result is very satisfying!
