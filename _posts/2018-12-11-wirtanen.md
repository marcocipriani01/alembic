excerpt: I've taken some 45 seconds exposures (ISO 800, for about one hour, with some
  delay between each photo) from my backyard and then I made this timelapse. Since
  the comet was really fast (long focal length, 1000, and APS-C sensor), I had to
  delete several frames, so the video has only 19 frames, manually processed in Astro
  Pixel Processor and then edited in a video with Kdenlive.

### My result

I've taken some 45 seconds exposures (ISO 800, for about one hour, with some delay between each photo) from my backyard and then I made this timelapse. Since the comet was really fast (long focal length, 1000, and APS-C sensor), I had to delete several frames, so the video has only 19 frames, manually processed in Astro Pixel Processor and then edited in a video with Kdenlive.
