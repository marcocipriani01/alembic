  use of my telescope or for school projects. I also made some Arduino projects.

I'm an young astronomy enthusiast, attending the high school somewhere in Italy. In my free time I take photos of the universe with my telescope, and I often write some programs or Android applications to simplify the use of it. I also motorized the focuser of my SkyWatcher Newton OTA on my own, creating a 3D model for the brackets, programming an Arduino, a software on the computer and connecting some wires.
Together with astronomy, I made some projects for school, like an application to factorize polynomials and a digital pendulum, and some electronic projects like a Bluetooth car.

## Astronomy pictures
Check out my blog for them!

## Projects for my telescope
Hope you'll enjoy them all!

### [OpenFocuser](projects/OpenFocuser)
MoonLite-compatible motorized focuser controller with absolute and relative positioning and half and full step switching.
Linux & MacOS (INDI) and Windows (MoonLite and ASCOM) compatible.
Doesn't support temperature compensation.
Comes in two editions: standard and Plus, which has a non-MoonLite extra function to control all the Arduino's digital and PWM pins, so that you can turn on and off (or regulate in current) other devices like dew heaters, mirror coolers, or even a Raspberry Pi directly from your computer, or remotely if you use an INDI server.

## Some projects from my past

### [MathsTests](projects/MathsTests)
Don't you think that Maths hard? Right, but I love it. That's why I made this app: MathsTests can help you factorizing polynomials using the Ruffini's rule, and particular trinomials! Fast, lightweight and Open-source, it's a great app for everyone who needs help with polynomials. Psss... I'm not in charge of your bad marks if you use it during tests!

### [JustAPendulum](projects/JustAPendulum)
JustAPendulum is an Arduino-based open source pendulum that can process the measured oscillation period to find the [gravitational acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_acceleration) of the Earth (~9,8 m/s²). It contains an homemade [Arduino UNO](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno) that uses an USB-to-Serial Adapter to communicate with your computer. JustAPendulum is highly accurate and with a large variety of tools, using its companion, written in Visual Basic .NET using [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/). Completely laser cutted and homemade, it is easy-to-use: if everything is OK, it always runs as fast as possible, without errors.

Discover the great performances of JustAPendulum on its page!

### [RoverBluetooth](projects/RoverBluetooth)
This was my first project and was borns for my school exams at the age of thirteen. This car is based on an [Arduino UNO](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno), world's #1 open-source board and is made only from low-cost components, easy to find everywhere: nothing must be made with a special machine! An old [Meccano®](http://www.meccano.com/) pack is all you need for the body of this car. Will you love it?
