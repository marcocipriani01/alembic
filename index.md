I'm a young astronomy enthusiast, maker and aerospace engineering student based in Rome, Italy. I spend my free time creating projects, mainly motorized focusers and software for telescopes and astronomical observatories. Whether I need to program, create an electric circuit or do CAD design, I'm all in ready to learn and complete the project.

## Astrophotography

I own a newtonian telescope and an EQ5 mount. Most of it, from the focuser to the power controller and the motors, has been made by me over the years. Now, the whole setup can be remotely controlled right from my desk thanks to a Raspberry Pi and all the custom electronics. Unfortunately, I live in a heavily light-polluted area, but I'm planning on developing a battery unit and go on the mountains some nights... Despite of this fact, I managed to take great shots of both galaxies and nebulae, go check them out [in the blog](blog/)!
