### [JustAPendulum](JustAPendulum)

JustAPendulum is an open-source digital pendulum able to measure its oscillation period to calculate the [gravitational acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_acceleration) of the Earth (~9,81 m/s²). It contains a DIY [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), which can also connect to a computer to visualize graphs and analyse the data using its companion software. JustAPendulum is accurate and easy-to-use, which makes it perfect to explain physics in classes and engage the students. All you have to do is push a button, let the mass fall and the board will calculate everything!

### [MathsTests](MathsTests)

MathsTests is a simple app that can factorize polynomials using Ruffini’s rule.

### [RoverBluetooth](RoverBluetooth)

This was my first project, which I made it for my school exams at the age of thirteen. Exhibited at  [Maker Faire Rome](http://www.makerfairerome.eu/)! This car is based on an [Arduino UNO](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno) and is made only from low-cost components, easy to find everywhere: nothing needs to be made with professional equipment! An old [Meccano®](http://www.meccano.com/) pack is all you need for the body of this car, while a driver, a motor, a battery pack and an ultrasonic distance sensor are required for the circuit.
