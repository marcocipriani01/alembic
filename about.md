excerpt: Iâ€™m a young astronomy enthusiast, attending the high school somewhere in
  Italy. In my free time, I take photos of the universe with my telescope and I often
  write some programs, utilities or Android applications to simplify its use. In my
  website I describe my projects and publish my photos of the universe.

### The author

I'm a young astronomy enthusiast, maker and aerospace engineering student based in Rome, Italy. I spend my free time creating projects, mainly motorized focusers and software for telescopes and astronomical observatories. Whether I need to program, create an electric circuit or do CAD design, I'm all in ready to learn and complete the project.
